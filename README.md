# Working with Tidy Tools for Time-Series data


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to tidy tools for time-series data. Time-series data is a time-ordered sequence of observations, which is very common in practice. The three packages `Tsibble`, `Fable` and `Feasts` provide tools and solutions to handle this kind of data in the different core steps of the data science workflow. They will be presented and practiced in this class.


You can run the 'learnr'-tutorial included in the practice materials by cloning the repo and running the following line of code:
```
rmarkdown::run("materials/learnr - Tidy tools for time series data.Rmd")
```

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with theoretical knowledge about time-series data, (2) show you the three main tidy tools for handling time-series data, and (3) provide you with practice materials as well as some further readings and video material.
