# What are time-series data? A little statistics recap!

#### "A time series is defined as a time-ordered sequence of observations taken at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)." (Kotu and Deshpande, 2019)


#### Main concepts include: 
- *Trends:* refer to the long-term movement or direction in the data, showing an overall upward or downward progression over time.
- *Seasonality:* refers to repeating patterns or fluctuations that occur at regular intervals over time. These patterns are often driven by external, cyclical factors, such as seasons, months, or days of the week, and they tend to recur at the same point in each cycle.
- *Cyclic patterns:* refer to fluctuations that occur over longer periods of time but do not follow a fixed, regular interval like seasonality. These patterns rise and fall due to long-term influences, such as economic cycles, and can vary in both duration and amplitude.

#### Applications and example
Forecasting and trend analysis are some of the most widespread applications of time-series data. Example: monitoring and predicting unemployment rates.

# Working with time-series data can be challenging

##### Missing data / Outliers

Missing data or outliers can distort time-series analysis by introducing gaps or extreme values that don't fit the general pattern. 

##### Non-Stationarity

Non-stationarity means that the statistical properties of a time series, like its mean or variance, change over time, making it difficult to predict.

##### Handling multiple time-series

When working with multiple time series it becomes challenging to manage and analyze them simultaneously. Organizing and structuring them properly is key to identifying trends and patterns efficiently across all series.

##### Availability of tidy data

Time-series data is often messy and not ready for analysis, making it harder to apply standard tools (e.g., data format issues).

# General information on the Tsibble package

#### "The tsibble package provides a data infrastructure for tidy temporal data with wrangling tools. Adapting the tidy data principles, tsibble is a data- and model-oriented object." (Wang, Cook and Hyndman, 2019)

Developed by Earo Wang, Di Cook, Rob Hyndman and Mitchell O'Hara-Wild.

# Why work with tsibble?

- *Part of Tidyverse*, tsibble aligns with the "tidy" principles of the tidyverse (i.e., every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every dataset is one table). Allow seamless integration with tidyverse  packages like dplyr, ggplot2, or tidyr.

- Provides a set of tools and functions which make it *easier to prepare time-series data for analysis, visualization and forecasting* (e.g., missing data handling, duplicates check, etc.).

- Facilitates dealing with *multiple and large volumes of time-series data* (using the key and index structure).

---


# The three pillars of tsibble

1. *Index:* Index is a variable representing time ordered from past to present.
2. *Key:*  Single or multiple variables that identify units over time.
3. *Interval:* There are three possible interval types: fixed, unknown, and irregular. Event data
typically involves irregular time intervals (e.g., flight schedules) which can flow into event-based data modeling, but would need to be processed, or regularized, to fit models that expect data with a fixed-time interval -> measurements.

<div align="center">
<br>
<img src="pics/tsibble-semantics.png" height=200>
</div>

##### From these pillars, the four tsibble rules can be derived.


---


# The four tsibble rules (Wang, Cook and Hyndman, 2019)

##### The “tidy data” principles are adapted in tsibble with the following rules:
1. Index is a variable with inherent ordering from past to present. 
2. Key is a set of variables that define observational units over time.
3. Each observation should be uniquely identified by index and key.
4. Each observational unit should be measured at a common interval, if regularly spaced.
</br>

<div align="center">
<br>
<img src="pics/tsibble-example-paper.png" height=200>
</div>

Example given in the paper: The column 'year' represents the index, the columns 'country', 'gender' and 'continent' represent the keys and 'count' is the only measurement.

# Tsibble's main verbs

`as_tsibble()` :  Converts data into a "tsibble". "Tsibbles" are the starting point for using the tsibble package. It allows you to specify the index and key.
`my_tsibble <- as_tsibble(data, index = date, key = id)`

`has_gaps()` and `count_gaps()` : Check and counts missing time points.
`my_tsibble %>% count_gaps()`

`fill_gaps()` : Missing values are filled in with NAs.

`index_by()` : Group data by time the index. Similar to dplyr:group_by(). Can be collapsed with summarise().

`group_by_key()` : Groups data by the key. Similar to dplyr:group_by(). Can be collapsed with summarise().

`interval()` : Extracts and verifies the time interval between observations.

`index()` : Extracts the index (time variable) from a tsibble.

# Why work with Fable?

### 
- Provides a collection of commonly used *univariate and multivariate time series forecasting models* including exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling.

- *Extends with functionalities* of the "forecast" and "tsibble" packages.

- Provides a set of tools to *evaluate, visualise and combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse*.

- *Seamless integration* with tidyverse.

*Practical use cases*: Predict future sales based on historical trends, understand energy usage by time of day or season.

---


#Fable's main verbs 

`fable()`: create a fable, which is a tidy representation of a model.

`ETS()` and `ARIMA()` are the two widely used models.

`model()`: specify and estimate time series forecasting models. Define models such as ARIMA, ETS and others in a tidy framework. This function returns a *mable* (model table). 

`mable`: contains a row for each time series (uniquely identified by the key variables) and a column for each model specification.

`glance()`: provides a quick, high level summary of model performance and provides concise overview of the key metrics and diagnostics of the model. 

`report()`: provides detail summary of the model's components and estimates (when working with one specific model).

`autoplot()`: to see historical data along with the forecasts.

`components()`: extract and view different components (trend, seasonal, etc) of a time series model.

# Why work with Feasts

- *Works alongside the tsibble and fable packages* to provides a comprehensive framework for time series exploration.

- *Decomposition of time series* into components (trend, seasonality, etc).

- *Extraction* of useful statistical features.

- *Provides for visual tools* for summarizing and analyzing time series behaviour.

*Practical use cases*: analyse the underlying components of time series, such as trends and seasonality, for better insights.
---

# Feasts main verbs

`STL()`: Decomposes time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder components, helps visualise and analyse the underlying patterns in the data.

`feast_acf()`: Extracts autocorrelation features from time series to identify relationships between time lags.

`ACF()`: Plots autocorrelation function of a time series and helps visualise the correlation between a time series and time lags.

`feasts()`: A wrapper function that extracts a large number of features from the time series in a single step. Quick way to get a comprehensive feature set for model building or analysis.
